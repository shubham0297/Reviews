### Application correctly returns :
* **200 status code :white_check_mark:**
*  **JSON response with the message: `‚ÄúOK - healthy‚Äù`  on hitting the **/healthz** endpoint :white_check_mark:**

***
## Suggestion
So far, we have used a hardcoded message to report the application state e.g. `OK - healthy`. In a real case scenario, the health check endpoint is dynamic, reflecting if the application is capable of handling requests.

You can try to extend the /healthz endpoint to **return a 500 HTTP ERROR - unhealthy error if the connection to the database fails or if the required posts table does not exist.**

### Note 
To validate your endpoint, try deleting the database.db file and check if the endpoint is returning a 500 error.

Well done!  Logs have been correctly recorded :white_check_mark:


## Whats done correctly :heavy_check_mark:
### Great work recording the following events to STDOUT & STDERR :
* **Accessing an article :white_check_mark:**
* **Access "About Us" page :white_check_mark:**
* **A new article is created  :white_check_mark:**
* **404 pages when a non-existing articles are accessed :white_check_mark:**

## What requires change 

* **Logs have been captured at the DEBUG level. However, the specification requires us to record the logs to both `STDOUT & STDERR`. **
* The STDOUT uses `sys.stdout` and the STDEER uses the `sys.stderr`. To get an idea about the same, you can take a look at the code given below :point_down:

```
# set logger to handle STDOUT and STDERR 
 stdout_handler =  # stdout handler 
 stderr_handler =  # stderr handler 
 handlers = [stderr_handler, stdout_handler]
# format output
 format_output = # formating output here

 logging.basicConfig(format=format_output, level=logging.DEBUG, handlers=handlers)

```
* When the application encounters an **ERROR**, the logs should reflect the same and show it as error. However, in the current application, when existing the **non-existing article**, the logs capture it as a successful event and is captured at DEBUG level instead of ERROR level :point_down:

* [**Python Logging Guide ‚Äì Best Practices**](https://coralogix.com/blog/python-logging-best-practices-tips/)




## REQUIRES CHANGE

As mentioned in the specification- **You need to add logs to the application by recording the following events to STDOUT & STDERR: ** 
* Access an article
* 404 pages when a non-existing articles are accessed
* Access "About Us" page
* A new article is created

When recording the log, you also need to make sure that - 
* **Python generic logs are recorded at DEBUG level**
* **Each logline should have a timestamp**

### NOTE
**Once you make the required changes, make sure to update the `docker_commands` file by pasting the updated logs**

***
As of now,  I can see only one log - when accessing the metric :point_down:

**The ERROR message is recorded on every event starting from beginning. As soon as we land on the home page or access any page, the logs record the ERROR which is not correct. This can be seen below :point_down:

![Screenshot from 2021-07-06 15-02-50.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1625564052/Screenshot_from_2021-07-06_15-02-50.png)

Please ensure that the ERROR message is recorded only in case of actual error. For eg. on Accessing a non-existent article id.

## Hi Gage !!
You have done a great job considering it was your first attempt.**You have worked really well  with Docker, Github Actions, Helm and ArgoCD**  :clap: However, there is a small change required in order for you to pass this project successfully :
* **You need to capture the logs to `STDOUT` and `STDERR` and capture the log header as `ERROR` in case the user tries to access a non-existing article**


Hope you make the required changes soon. We look forward to receiving your future project submissions soon .

## Hi !!
You have done a great job considering it was your first attempt.**You have worked really well  with Docker, Github Actions, Helm and ArgoCD**  :clap: However, there are few changes required in order for you to pass this project successfully :
* The application logs the **ERROR** message without even the ERROR occurring. This needs to be fixed**
* **The screenshot for `kubectl get all -n sandbox` shows the pods in Error status and not Running. This needs fixing as well**

Hope you make the required changes soon. We look forward to receiving your future project submissions soon .

**Great job making the connection count as Global variable :clap: **

**Great work capturing the logs at `DEBUG level`. However you need to capture the events to `STDERR` and `STDOUT` as mentioned in the project review**

**Since this block of the function means the article is non-existent, therefore instead of `app.logger.info`, you should use `app.logger.error` **

**Good to see that you have captured the log at correct level** :clap:

Good to see that you have used parameterized value throughout the YAML and not hard coded anything  :clap:
