###  **S3 bucket is visible in the AWS Management console. :heavy_check_mark:**

Here is the official document of [Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html) . It tells you everything you  need to know about  S3 starting from creating a bucket to security policies.


Nice job! I see a S3 bucket specified in the AWS management console. :white_check_mark:



### **You need to include screenshots such that S3 bucket is visible in  the AWS Management console. For eg. :point_down:**

###  **CloudFront has been enabled to retrieve and distribute website files. :heavy_check_mark:**

***
### Note üí°
**We know that you have done everything correctly (as the website is correctly accessible through the CloudFront domain name URL). However, as per the rubric - **
```
The screenshot should say `Enabled` under the `State` column
```
** So, please attach the expected screenshot in order to pass the specification.**
**************************************************************************************************************************************************
## Website is accessible publicly through both the  endpoints. :heavy_check_mark:

### 1. CloudFront domain name url :white_check_mark:

***
### 2. Website endpoint url :white_check_mark:

***
### 3. S3-Object url :white_check_mark:


## 1. **You have provided the CloudFront domain name and the website is accessible :heavy_check_mark:**


### 2. Website endpoint url :white_check_mark:
**You also need to  provide the `S3 website-endpoint URL` for the website in the README file.It should be something like : **
### `http://{name}.s3-website.{region}.amazonaws.com/`



**The website is not accessible through the CloudFront domain name. :point_down:**
![Screen2022-05-20_20-0420-04-14.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1653057632/Screen2022-05-20_20-0420-04-14.png)
* **The site should be accessible with just the CloudFront domain name URL. As of now, the website is accessible when we append `index.html` at the end. You should ensure that the Default Root Object from the CloudFront Distribution should be set to index.html so that whenever the user hits the CloudFront Domain name URL, it renders the index.html page**
* **Please ensure that website can be accessed without appending the object name at the end ie. index.html**


I have included some resources that might help you troubleshoot :
* [CloudFront to serve requests for S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3/)
* [Resolving  "CloudFront wasn't able to connect to the origin"](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/resolve-cloudfront-connection-error/#:~:text=HTTP%20502%20errors%20from%20CloudFront,aren't%20supported%20by%20CloudFront.&text=The%20custom%20origin%20isn't,settings%20of%20the%20CloudFront%20distribution.)


You have provided the CloudFront domain name and the website is accessible :point_down:
![Screenshot from 2021-07-14 02-50-38.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1626211247/Screenshot_from_2021-07-14_02-50-38.png)

## NOTE
You need to also provide the **S3 website-endpoint URL** for the website.It should be something like :
`http://{name}.s3-website.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/`

**Though you have attached the screenshot for website in the submission, you still need to provide the CloudFront domain name URL and the website-endpoint  URL in your README file.Please make sure you send these URL in your next submission.**


You need to provide the S3 website-endpoint URL, this is required by the review rubric. The URL that you provided is not the correct one. Depending on your Region, your Amazon S3 website endpoint follows one of these two formats. ‚ùå
* s3-website dash (-) Region ‚Äê http://bucket-name.s3-website-Region.amazonaws.com
* s3-website dot (.) Region ‚Äê http://bucket-name.s3-website.Region.amazonaws.com
The website-endpoint URL should work without appending /index.html at the end

You should a Cloudfront URL. In this [tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/getting-started/S3/) you can learn how to make your website to use cloudfront. This makes that the website loads faster.‚ùå

You have done a great job considering it was your first attempt.I really like how you have combined all the screenshot into a pdf which saves a lot of time while reviewing the project :clap:. You are really close to the appropriate project and just need to make a small change (**include screenshot showing all the files in the S3 bucket**) before you are all set to go.

**README** file usually describes what kind of project it is, how it can be useful, how to install and use it.
Try to update the README file by including some points such as Requirements,Installation, deployment etc. Check out the template for README üëâ   https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2
It will become easier for people other than project developers to understand the project and run it with ease.
