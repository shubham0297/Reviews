> All the required submission parts are included :
* *Executive Summary* ✅
* *Business Opportunity* ✅
* *Project Description* ✅
* *Dependencies and Constraints* ✅
* *Benefits and ROI* ✅
* *Estimated Timeline* ✅
*************************************************************************************************************************************

> ### *1. You have correctly provided relevant background information of the domain from which the idea is proposed*✅
> ### *2. The idea is well articulated and the importance of the idea is mentioned as well *✅


## What is done correctly :heavy_check_mark:
**You have correctly provided relevant background information of the domain from which the idea is proposed :white_check_mark:**

## What is missing :x:
* In the Executive summary, **you need to mention what the actual Idea is**. Currently I see that you mentioned, where the idea can be used but haven't mentioned the idea.
* **When mentioning the `Summary` you need to include the following 3 points ** 
  * How the idea is important to your role ? 
  * How the idea is important to your department ?
  * How the idea is important to your company ?

Currently these points are missing. For example, look how the person has mentioned the importance for his idea of implementation of Agile Methodology in the organization :point_down:

![ImportanceProposal .png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1629578218/ImportanceProposal_.png)
*************************************************************************************************************************************

### Its really good to see that you have backed-up the idea with proper facts :heavy_check_mark:


### Suggestion
Visual presentation tends to have stronger impact on the viewer and it sustains in the viewer's memory for a long time. I would suggest, if possible, you can add some visual diagram too. For example, look at how the user backs up his idea about migrating to Agile methodology by some survey result and graph. 
![Survey.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1629568806/Survey.png)

![Bug graph.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1629568810/Bug_graph.png)





## What is done correctly :heavy_check_mark:
* The business challenge/opportunity is very well explained. I can understand the need of the idea by going through this section once. :white_check_mark:
* The challenge/opportunity  has the  ** domain specific information . ** :white_check_mark:


## What is missing :x:
* Though there is no set word count to meet this criteria. you still need to include **at least 2-5 paragraphs** :x:
* The challenge/opportunity should have **some domain specific information (facts, information, data). ** :x:
* You need to include some facts and figures in support of your idea. For example, look at how the user backs up his idea about migrating to Agile methodology by some survey result and graph. Visual and factual numbers tend to have stronger impact on the viewer. 

![Survey.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1629568806/Survey.png)

![Bug graph.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1629568810/Bug_graph.png)






> ### 1. *The business challenge/opportunity is very well formulated. You have separated the challenges/opportunity into 2 paragraphs which makes it easily readable ✅*
### 2. The challenge/opportunity  has the  `domain specific information`. ✅*

### Suggestion
* It would be even better if you include some **facts and figures to support the idea** 
* Look at how the user backs up his idea about migrating to Agile methodology by some survey result and graph. Visual and factual numbers tend to have stronger impact on the viewer. 

![Survey.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1629568806/Survey.png)

![Bug graph.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1629568810/Bug_graph.png)



### Why is this important
When proposing a business idea to the senior management and stakeholder, you should always add some facts and figures showing the comparison of some metric **before and after implementation of the idea**. This usually catches the interest of the viewer/listener as he/she might not have in-depth knowledge of the technology behind the idea. All they care is about how the idea can benefit the organization as compared to the current technology being used. So, adding some survey results or figurative comparison we immediately draw their attention.



*************************************************************************************************************************************
> ### *1. The solution is separated into 3 paragraphs which makes it easier on eyes ✅*


> ### 2. Also the  provided solution is :
* *Quantifiable* ✅
* *Measureable* ✅
* *Replicable* ✅


> ### *What is done correctly ✅*
* *The `Robo-Agent` business idea is very clear and focused which makes it very easy to understand  ✅*
* *Great work mentioning the advantages/benefits of using the `Customer segmentation` technique  ✅*


> ##### *What is missing ❌*
* As mentioned in above specification, you need to **keep atleast 2-5 paragraphs for Project Description section too** :x:
* When presenting a solution to the problem , you need to ensure that the solution is :

### Quantifiable 
This part of the solution discusses about **where the solution could be implemented** ie. to which project domains is the solution applicable. So, you need to tell - which all project domains could use the idea of customer segmentation

### Measurable
You need to provide some kind of **metric to measure the effectiveness of the solution.**This is an important part because without some kind of metric, no new solution is implemented in an organization. The metric could be anything such as time, money, resource etc. Please include some metric to your solution, which can be compared before and after implementing the solution.

### Replicable
As the name suggests, the solution should be easily replicable. **You can provide some kind of model / implementation diagram / architecture diagram to show you solution which can be later replicated in the organization. ** For example, a business idea of using Machine Learning in an organization can be overviewed as  :point_down:

![Arch Diag.jpeg](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1629570108/Arch_Diag.jpeg)

*************************************************************************************************************************************

> ### *1. The timeline of the idea is estimated using months ie. 6 months ✅*
### *2. The key milestones have been listed ✅*

### Visual Impact last longer in the memory. Good to see that you have used visual representation of the timeline.


## What is done correctly :heavy_check_mark:
The timeline of the idea is estimated using months ie. 6 months :white_check_mark:


## What is missing  :x:
As mentioned in the rubric point, you need to **explain the key milestones in the timeline.** One way to do this is by dividing  the timeline into several milestones  and mention the estimated time for each one.   For example, see how a person has divided the overall timeline of idea implementation into several points :point_down:


![ProjectTimeline.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1629571071/ProjectTimeline.png)

### Suggestion 💡
**As mentioned before, visual impacts are stronger that theoretical impact. You may consider adding visual timeline. In case you wish to explore the same, here are some [Free Powerpoint Timeline Diagrams](https://www.free-powerpoint-templates-design.com/free-powerpoint-diagrams-design/free-powerpoint-timeline-diagrams/)**

*************************************************************************************************************************************
> ### *Great work adding the quantifiable estimation of the benefits and ROI of the idea. ✅*


***
** Additional Reading 💡**
**You can read more about the KPIs in this blog - [10 KPIs to measure Project ROI](https://www.sciforma.com/blog/10-kpis-measure-project-roi)**




### Great work adding the some  benefits and ROI for the idea. However, the ROI needs to be something which is quantifiable. For example, time, money etc. As of now, I can find any such ROI in your project model :point_down:
 


### Why this is Important ?
As per personal point of view, the project implementation ideas and benefits looks great. However think from an organization point of view, if you present this idea to senior management or director, the first thing they would look at is the **Profit - be it in terms of time or in terms of money**. So, it becomes most important to include the quantifiable information in order to get attention of higher management.
Try to update this section and  some measurable ROI. 
*************************************************************************************************************************************

> ###  *Dependencies, constraints and risks have been highlighted. Well done ! ✅*


## What is done correctly :heavy_check_mark:
* **Dependencies have been listed ** :white_check_mark:

## What is missing  :x:
**You need to add the `constraints` too. Constraints and risks can go together. You can describe the potential threats to the project succeeding, such as not getting support or resources etc .**
*************************************************************************************************************************************

## Hi  !!
You have done an excellent job considering it was your first attempt. 
Few things that I liked about your submission :
*  Its good to see that **you have covered all the sections of the documents (even the optional `Use Case` section too) ** :clap: 
* All the sections are very ** well formatted using bullet points instead of paragraphs**  which makes it easier on eyes :clap:
* **Adding facts and figures to your idea and also representing the idea implementation timeline in a visual format** :clap:

***
You are really close to the appropriate project and just need to make couple of small changes before you're all set to go :
* In **Executive summary, try to explain about how the idea is important to your role, your department  and your company**
* **Add some facts and figures to your business idea in the `Business Opportunity` section**
* **Ensure that the idea in the `Project Description` section is Quantifiable, Measurable and Replicable. You can read more about it in the project review. **
* **Provide key milestones in the timeline for idea implementation**

Hope you make the required changes soon. We look forward to receiving your future project submission soon .
