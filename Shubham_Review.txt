Great! The **current resident** area is mentioned. âœ…

**Good, you've asked a reasonable price.**
As a beginner freelancer you have started with a good hourly rate, the more you complete gigs and gain more experience, the more you can ask for your hourly rate in the future.


* **Fiverr :x:** 

The gig is currently missing on the Fiverr profile, you must have to add that before the next submission.

Good, you've asked a reasonable price.

--------------------------

**Addressed client name** âœ…
It's always good to use salutation at the beginning, it acts as a good gesture and you have done it perfectly.


+++++++++++++++

Missing salutations with the client's name at the beginning of both the proposals.

**Correct example:** Dear john
**Incorrect examples:** Dear sir/madam, Dear XXXX

*** Note: *** If post doesn't have any name then you can use any name as your Client name, example **Dear john**


----------------------

**This looks good**. It's important that the proposal is not lengthy as the employer may not have enough time to read through a lengthy proposal.


-----------------------

Good job while adding a **precise and suitable** introduction.

----------------------
Similar projects have been listed in the proposals :white_check_mark:

*** Suggestion ***
If available, I would request you to add the Github links/sample screenshots to your projects in the proposal itself. While not mandatory, the clients can take a look at them directly and can make an informed decision on whether to hire you or not based on the quality of your projects.

++++++++++
You must have to list similar projects you worked on before on both the proposals or you can provide some links to your sample projects.
It helps the client to look at your work and it also increases the chances of acceptance.


---------------------

* Steps to be mentioned in bullet points not in a paragraph âœ…
* The project implementation model must follow the project owner's timeline âœ…

++++++++++++++++++++++

Please add the appropriate implementation model in bullet points with timelines.
Check the below screenshot,
[Capture.PNG](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/270766/1619213574/Capture.PNG)

-----------------------

Project proposals contain a reasonable bidding amount :white_check_mark:

+++++++++

Missing bidding amount in the word file. You must have to add the bidding amount in both the proposals on word file as per requirement.



Bidding price usually means the amount you would take to complete the required request. So you could either :

* Mention the price for the complete project. For eg. 50$ or 100$ etc.
* Mention your hourly rate and then specify the estimated number of hours it would take to complete the project. For eg. 7$/hr and it would take 5 hrs to do the project

**Note:** Currently the hourly rate is only written in the job description, you should also have to write your acceptance/proposed hourly rate in the proposals also.

-------++++++++++_-----------\


** Proposal 1: :white_check_mark:**

***
** Proposal 2: :negative_squared_cross_mark:**
 Both the proposals are identical, you must have to create two different proposals as per requirement.

### Hi,

I really appreciate the hard work you put in completing this assignment.

Good job while setting up LinkedIn and freelancing profiles.

But there is some more work you have to do according to the rubrics.

Don't worry! It's nothing to be afraid of as it is just part of your learning process.

Good Luck!:smiley:

**Keep learning & stay Udacious :udacious:**

***
***Note:*** You must have to create two different proposals, currently both the proposals are 100% identical. Basically you have to write 2nd proposals to provide some different service than you have written in first proposal.
For example: As I can see in **skill** section of your **linkedIn profile** that you are also good at **teaching and writing**, you can use these skills for your second proposal. 
***

Good attempt, but your proposal needs a little work, you only introduced yourself and gave examples of your past projects. There is more that needs to go into your profile, read my comments below for a guide on how to make corrections

Start with greeting the client, correct example - Dear John
Take time to include few lines of introduction, talking about your educational journey, skills and experience.
Prove your competence to the client by including examples of past projects (e.g links).
List out your implementation model i.e how you intend to do the job in bullet points.
Include a line on your bidding amount model, Since you are just starting, kindly limit your bidding amount to 5 - 10 $/hr, you can increase as you begin to get more gigs.
Lastly, Take note of the rubric instructions when writing the proposals.

### Hi !!
I really appreciate the hard work you put in completing this assignment especially considering it was your first attempt. 
But there is some more work you have to do according to the rubrics.
Don't worry! It's nothing to be afraid of as it is just part of your learning process.
I especially liked your proposal which follows all the required points except the salutation. Providing the similar projects and project implementation model is a thing that most people miss in their first attempt, but you provided both. Well done :clap:
You are close to the appropriate project but you need to work on few things.
Below are some highlights of required changes,

** LINKEDIN **
Add task and activities bullet points for all the roles under your experience section on LinkedIn profile.

** FIVERR **
Add a gig showing hourly rate for the service you'll be providing.

** PROPOSALS **
Correct salutation in both the proposals as mentioned in the project review.

Please check the project review section to know more.

Hope you make the required changes soon. We look forward to receiving your future project submissions soon .

Hi Student,

You still have not added the list of similar projects that you have done in the past in both the proposals,

In both proposals, you have briefly explained your relevant work experience but in addition to that, you have to describe at least one relevant project that you have done in past in the proposal itself to strengthen your proposals.

### What you need to include?
* **Project title** - Description in 2-3 Sentences
* Add reference link/sample screenshots/ git URL of your work

### Example
* **Market Analysis Report for National Clothing Chain** - I recently worked with the national clothing chain to check the demand for the products in the current market. I created various statistical models to predict the relationship between the income of the individual and their expenses and in the end, I was able to build a power bi dashboard that recommends the products based on the location and income of the individual. the company was able to increase its revenue by 63% within 3 months.

*** Suggestion; You can also add the projects that you have done in udacity nanodegree.***

### Importance of similar project,
Adding a list of similar projects with the reference links or sample screenshots will enable clients to take a quick look at your work and that's where your profile will shine and indeed this will improve the chance of selection.
