The diagram shows the movement of data from Staging to ODS to DWH to Reporting :white_check_mark:

## Whats done correctly :heavy_check_mark:
The diagram showing 8 files pointing to the staging database to ODS to DWH is included :white_check_mark:. 

## What requires change :x:
**After the dimensional modelling in DWH, it should point to the Reporting stage for reports. For examplel :point_down:**

**For this specification, you need to provide : **
* ** A table (can be drawn in MS-Word or Excel) with 3 column namely (Raw files, Staging and ODS)**
* **Each column should record the size of the data in the respective format.**
* **The table should have 8 rows , one corresponding for each of the  dataset.**

For eg. something like this 

```
Raw Files                         |    Staging                       |      ODS
yelp_Business (124MB)(Json)       |  Business (11.8MB)(gz)           |     14.4MB
yelp_reviews(6.9GB)(Json)         |  Reviews(2.5GB) (gz)             |     2.5GB
```

Great! ER diagram contains 8 tables, cross foot notations are perfect and it's good to see that you have considered Object datatype for Attributes and Hours column in the Business table in the ODS schema. âœ…

**ER Diagram has been included for all the 8 tables. Well done ! :white_check_mark:

The diagram of `star schema` with `dimensions` and `fact` tables has been represented correctly.  :white_check_mark:


* **You need to provide a diagram of Star Schema with dimensions and fact tables**.
* **Star schema should contain one fact table with several independent relationships.**.

## Hi There !
You did a great job considering it was your first attempt. I like the fact that you have correctly moved the data from **Staging** to **ODS** to **Data Warehouse**. Most of the people make mistakes while transferring the data from Staging to ODS but you have done it correctly :clap:  You are  close to the appropriate project,however you need to correct some small points before you're all set to go. 

* **Provide a diagram showing the data flow from raw files to staging to ODS to DWH to Reporting**.
* ** Provide a table showing the size of data in raw, staging and ODS schema**.
* **Provide SQL query to show how data is integrated**.
* **Provide a diagram of star schema with fact and dimension tables**.
* **Provide SQL queries to report the business name, temperature, precipitation and ratings**.


Hope you make the required changes soon. We look forward to receiving your future project submissions soon .
