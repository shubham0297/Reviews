### Official Name :heavy_check_mark:
The name is grammatically correct and follows the naming standards :white_check_mark:

### Profile Picture :x:

### Profile summary must be authentic, not copied from the internet. :white_check_mark:
### Profile summary must reflect the student's cumulative experience and educational journey. :x:
While your summary contains some important details about you, it **does not reflect your cumulative educational and professional experience**  as mentioned in the specification. Ideally, your summary should contain the following:
* Your **education details**
* Your **work experience**
* **Stand-out project**, if available
* **Scholarships/awards**
* **Current skills and interests**

You could take look at a sample profile summary given below :point_down:

### Recommendation
I would recommend you to go through this [link](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/linkedin-best-practices/2016/7-linkedin-profile-summaries-that-we-love-and-how-to-boost-your-own) which contains a list of 10 professional summaries written by top professionals across the globe working in different domains. This will give you a good idea of how to tailor your summary to maximize your reach and visibility on LinkedIn.

Please make this change in the next submission.


### Suggestion
**As mentioned for LinkedIn, you can think about adding the cumulative educational journey as a part of your profile summary. Apart from this, you can talk more about**
* Tell who you are, and a little bit about your strengths as it applies to this field.
* What skills have you learned that will help make you great at this job?
* Where have you worked/what have you been doing over the last few years? If you're a new college grad, you can talk about projects/classes/internships.


**The specification states  that you  should have a profile summary.The summary should contain your cumulative experience and professional journey. Currently I  couldn't find any summary on your LinkedIn profile. Please add a brief profile summary.**
You could take look at a sample profile summary given below :point_down:

**Suggestion **
There are some grammatical errors in your profile summary that needs correction.The tool called [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) comes in handy in such work as it helps reduce grammatical and typographic errors to a bare minimum.

I will explain this requirement specification wise so that it becomes easier for you to understand what needs to be changed:
### 1. Must complete role title (start date, end date, month location, company).  :x:
Your profile does not have an **Experience** section.


**You need to add this and list your experiences.**

#### **WHAT IF YOU ARE A FRESHER?**
In case you are a fresher, you can list your internships or volunteering experiences here or the skills and projects that you done as a part of your educational journey so far. In case none of them is available, you can write freelancer as an experience.


### 2. Must enlist tasks and activities, not more than 5 bullet points. :warning:
As the **Experience** section is missing, this specification is not applicable currently.
However, I will still explain this so that it becomes easier for you to complete this portion in the future.

You can go through this [PowerPoint Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/157_eLbEd8N4VI3aKvrjFw7d_xXaokz96W-MjJJ7eEj8/edit#slide=id.g7470d268a8_0_114)  shared in the project instructions which contains a wonderful tutorial on how to set up your LinkedIn profile professionally. I will share a screenshot from this deck which is applicable for this rubric:

![PACT EXP.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1605247338/PACT_EXP.png)

Notice how the tasks have been listed along with appropriate figures wherever relevant and applicable. Listing your work experience along with your achievements and roles in this manner will improve your chances of being noticed on LinkedIn significantly!

Please add this to your next submission.

### Suggestion

**When mentioning the task and activities, it is recommended to follow the below mentioned format (also as shown in the screenshot above) :point_down:**

**`Achieved X, by doing Y, resulting in Z[Concrete impact of role (% change, $$)]`**


***************************************************************************************************************************

* Education is mentioned in chronological order from newest to oldest :white_check_mark:
* Certifications are listed :white_check_mark:
* Skill set is added :white_check_mark:

* Education is mentioned in chronological order from newest to oldest :white_check_mark:
* Skill set is added :white_check_mark:

### Suggestion
If available, **I would strongly recommend adding your gained certifications to the Licenses & Certifications section in your profile.**

### Why is this important?
Apart from strengthening your profile significantly, these certificates also instill confidence in the minds of the recruiters regarding your expertise in these certified domains, thereby increasing your chances of selection greatly.

**Please mention the starting and ending year for the following item. Mentioning only single year confuses the user about whether it is the starting year or the graduating year.  :point_down:**


## Education is mentioned in chronological order from newest to oldest :x:
**This is a mandatory section. You should mention all the education that you got in chronological order ( newest to the oldest)**
## Skill set is added :x:
**This is a mandatory section and should include all the relevant skills that you possess**

## Certifications are listed :x:
**This is an optional section but is always  good to have as it adds value to your profile. You can list any certifications(if you have) under this section**
***************************************************************************************************************************

Name is grammatically correct and profile picture is clear :white_check_mark:


You should **always keep the first letter of your first/middle/last name as upper case letter**. Kindly change the highlighted letters to upper case.


### Name :heavy_check_mark:
Name is grammatically correct :white_check_mark:

### Profile Photo :x:
As told for LinkedIn, kindly update the profile picture such that majority of the space covers your face. 


As mentioned for LinkedIn, please take a picture from close. Because of small and limited space , the current picture is not so clear and one can't see the face clearly. Please update it.  

### People Per Hour :heavy_check_mark:
The name is correct and following naming convention :white_check_mark:

### Guru :x:
Currently, the name ends with a number which is not the according to the convention.**The name section should just reflect your full name and nothing else** :point_down:


![Screenshot from 2020-12-16 02-54-27.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1608067560/Screenshot_from_2020-12-16_02-54-27.png)

### **TODO**
* Kindly remove the numeric part.
* If the platform doesn't allow in order to maintain unique names, then kindly mention the same in the **Notes** while submitting the project again 



### Guru :x:
The link you provided is not landing on your profile page. Kindly check and submit again. :point_down:
![2.gif](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1606002370/2.gif)

The name looks good on both the platform, however I would recommend to maintain consistency when it comes to name as well as profile picture across various platform. For example, the official name on LinkedIn mentions
`Yasmin Abdallah` whereas the People Per Hour mentions `Yasmin Abdallah` and even the pictures used are different on both the platform. This may, in some cases,  create a doubt about the identity.


## NOTE 
For this section, **links to any 2 freelancing platforms (Fiverr,People Per Hour, Guru) are needed**. Its good to see you have submitted all the three. This and following rubrics points of this section will be evaluated (marked as Meet Specification/Requires Changes) based on People Per Hour and Guru profile. Although feedback for Fiverr profile will also be provided, but it won't be considered to pass or fail a particular point.



### Sample Profile Picture
You can take the following profile picture as reference. It looks professional, clear and majority of the space covers the face :point_down:

***************************************************************************************************************************

Profile summary is authentic with educational and professional experience included :white_check_mark:


As mentioned for LinkedIn profile summary, **cumulative professional and educational journey(summary about college/university education) is missing on freelancing profiles too**.
Please correct it in the next submission.

Your profile summary  **does mention the cumulative professional journey ( `Digital Marketer` ) but lacks to mention the educational journey(summary about college/university education) **
Please correct it in the next submission.


**The profile summary  is missing cumulative professional and educational journey.**
You need to include you education (graduation/post-graduation) and your work experience (be it freelancing). Apart from that you can add the current skills and interests too. 

Please  **remove the number from the end of your name** (if the platform allows you to do the same) . Your name should just contain your full name.


### Suggestion
**As mentioned for LinkedIn, you can think about adding the cumulative educational journey as a part of your profile summary. Apart from this, you can talk more about**
* Tell who you are, and a little bit about your strengths as it applies to this field.
* What skills have you learned that will help make you great at this job?
* Where have you worked/what have you been doing over the last few years? If you're a new college grad, you can talk about projects/classes/internships.


**Note :** If the platform doesn't allow you to change it, please mention it in the student notes while submitting the project.

## Fiverr :x:
**I couldn't find the description section on your Fiverr Profile. Please write a brief summary about yourself covering cumulative educational and professional journey**

### Guru :x:
As mentioned before, the link provided by you needs to be updated for this specification to be completely checked.

## Guru  :x:
**I couldn't find any description on your Guru Profile. Please write a brief summary about yourself :point_down:**


Here is how you can update your profile :point_down:

## Freelancer :x:
**The profile summary is missing for your Freelancer profile. You need to include a profile summary that should sum up your professional experience and  educational journey(summary about college/university education) . Please add it to your profile**



Here are some example of profile summaries :point_down:

***************************************************************************************************************************
This specification will be checked once the profile summary is corrected according to the comments mentioned above.

* You didn't include any previous roles here. They are important, and should be included, even if it is a volunteering experience as you don't know who may need that, and you want to maximize chances. From your Linkedin profile though, you seem to have a lot of previous experience.

* Please do include previous roles held(title, start date, end date, location and company) and add bullet points (maximum of 5) to describe tasks and activities.

** Note : ** If the platform doesn't provide a place for you to add your experience, do provide it in the section where you talk about yourself, reserving a paragraph, or a couple of bullet points for that.


This specification would be checked once you make the changes to your freelancing profile summaries. 


## People Per Hour :heavy_check_mark:
**Role is mentioned correctly :point_down:**


## Fiverr :x:

* Please mention your **role** ie. the work you do or specialize in below your name on the freelancing profile.
* Talk about the **task and activities** in the profile summary.
For example :point_down:
![ROLE FIVERR.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1609074979/ROLE_FIVERR.png)

**Note :** If the platform doesn't provide a place for you to add your experience, do provide it in the section where you talk about yourself, reserving a paragraph, or a couple of bullet points for that.


This would let the people know immediately about your profession at a glance. Further they can go through the description to know more about you.
Here is how you can achieve the same :point_down:
![screenshot.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1615991913/screenshot.png)



Role is appropriately mentioned as caption in the profiles :white_check_mark:
This would let the people know immediately about your profession at a glance. Further they can go through the description to know more about you.



### Suggestion
**`Digital Marketer` would be a better role description instead of `Digital Marketing`**

**`Data Analyst` would be a better role description instead of `Data Analysis`**

## Freelancer :x:
Role is appropriately mentioned as caption in the profiles :white_check_mark:
This would let the people know immediately about your profession at a glance. Further they can go through the description to know more about you.


**However the `Experience section` is missing on your profile. Kindly add the same and mention the task and activities for each role that you would list under it.**

### Upwork:x:
**When writing the role, you want the viewers to know about your top skill or profession. A better suitable role description would be `Data Analyst` as compared to the current one :point_down:**


**Though the role is mentioned, but it doesn't actually tells much about your profession or skill. You should choose a role in such a way that a person looking at it instantly gets to know about your profession. I would suggest you to use the same role as mentioned on People Per Hour profile.**


** The Role section should represent the work you do or specialize in below your name on the freelancing profile. It should be chosen in such a way that lets the people know immediately about your profession at a glance. Further they can go through the description to know more about you. Currently I see you have used your name in the Role section. Use a role description instead. For eg. Data Analyst, Digital Marketer, Content Writer etc. **

  
***************************************************************************************************************************

**Educational details have been mentioned :white_check_mark:**


In order to pass this specification, you need to add the **education history,skills and certifications( if any)**  on the freelancing platforms as well.

## Freelancer Profile :heavy_check_mark:

** Note : ** If the platform doesn't provide a place for you to add  it, do provide it in the **About section** where you talk about yourself, reserving a paragraph, or a couple of bullet points for that.


In which course? Please mention the course name 
in which you did the Bachelor degree

**I could find the relevant skills,Education section  and Qualifications section. However, you also need to mention the discipline in which you completed the following item :point_down:**

Instead of mentioning the grade, you need to mention thecourse name in

*I could find the relevant skills but Education section (mandatory) and Qualifications(optional but recommended) are missing. Please add it in order to pass this specification*


In order to pass this specification, you need to add the education history,skills and certifications( if any)  in the freelancing platforms as well.

Country of residence is mentioned. This lets the project owner  know your current resident area to count the difference in timezones :white_check_mark:

## Proposal 1 :heavy_check_mark:


Salutation is used correctly  :white_check_mark:

I am sure that you understand why this is important, but I will still take this opportunity to explain this to you once. Starting the proposal with the name of the client is considered professional, but at the same time, it leaves a little personalized touch to the proposal that will help you to stand out from the crowd.

### Suggestion 
It would be good if you give a line break after the salutation and begin rest of the proposal from next line. For example.
```
Dear John,
...
...
```
It would be even better if you use **`Dear`** instead of **`Hello`** as it is considered much more professional.



## NOTE 
* For this and subsequent specifications to be evaluated you need to provide a word file with **two proposals ** for different freelancing sites. Currently I can see **only one proposal** which is for **People Per Hour** :point_down:

* It need not be a proposal for an actual request. If there are no requests on the freelancing platform, you can write any proposal of you own having the following format :point_down: 
 * Start with a salutation. For example Dear John,
 * Give brief introduction about yourself.
 * Mention some previous worked projects.
 * Mention the model you will follow for current request with steps.
 * Mention a bidding price.

* I'll be providing the feedback based on current proposal for People Per Hour alone, but you need to make sure that in next submission you add a similar proposal for **Fiverr profile** too.

### FEEDBACK FOR CURRENT PROPOSAL


As mentioned above, this specification will be fully evaluated once you submit a written proposal for Fiverr too.

**Salutation is not used correctly.:x:**
You need to address client by the name (for project purpose, use an imaginary name if not present in the actual request) . For example, **`Dear John`** / **`Hello John`** / **`Hi John`** etc.
As of now, you have used `Hello`, which is not a right way professionally. Take a look at the following salutation from a sample profile :point_down:


### Your Profile

### Sample Profile
![Salutation.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1605725468/Salutation.png)

I am sure that you understand why this is important, but I will still take this opportunity to explain this to you once. Starting the proposal with the name of the client is considered professional, but at the same time, it leaves a little personalized touch to the proposal that will help you to stand out from the crowd.




**Salutation is not used correctly.:x:**
You need to address client by the name (for project purpose, you can use an imaginary name if not present in the actual request or simply right Hi/Hello, ) . For example,  **`Hello John`** / **`Hi John`** etc.
As of now, you have used `Dear everybody`, which is overly formal . Here are some example for your reference :
  * **Correct example:**  "Hello John," - "Hi John" :white_check_mark:
  * **Incorrect example:**"Dear Sir/Madam," - "Dear John" :x:



## NOTE
* For this and subsequent specifications to be evaluated you need to provide a link to a different freelancing site (other than **`UPWORK`**) . As you can see below, accepted platforms are :
 * Fiverr
 * Guru
 * People Per Hour
![Rubric.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1605456750/Rubric.png)

* I'll be providing the feedback based on current submission for Fiverr alone, but you need to make sure that in next submission you separate new profile link.

### FEEDBACK FOR CURRENT PROPOSAL

## NOTE
* For this and subsequent specifications to be evaluated you need to provide a separate word file with two proposals for different freelancing sites. Currently I can see one file having Links to all your profiles as well as the proposal. Kindly split them into two, one having all the links and other having just the proposals.
* I'll be providing the feedback based on current proposals, but you need to make sure that in next submission you separate the proposals from the profiles links. Also in that document, there is no need to attach screenshot of freelancing profiles( Guru and Fiverr). Just a written proposal is more than enough.
* The proposal should have the following format :point_down:
 * Start with a salutation. For example Dear John,
 * Give brief introduction about yourself.
 * Mention some previous worked projects.
 * Mention the model you will follow for current request with steps.
 * Mention a bidding price.

For example take a reference from the following proposal :point_down:
![Full.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1603134812/Full.png)
### FEEDBACK FOR CURRENT PROPOSAL
Guru proposal :white_check_mark:
Salutation is correctly used here
Fiverr propsal :x:
Salution should be of format Dear John(or any other name). As you now you have just mentioned Dears which is incorrect :point_down:



 
You need to start the Fiverr proposal same way like the Peopleperhour proposal ie. with Salutation.
In Fiverr proposal, you can take a random project requirement statement and create a proposal for that. It not need be an acutal job requests.


## NOTE
* For this and subsequent specifications to be evaluated you need to provide a separate word file with two proposals for different freelancing sites. Currently I can see one file having Links to all your profiles as well as the proposal. Kindly split them into **two**, one having all the links and other having just the proposals.
* I'll be providing the feedback based on current proposals, but you need to make sure that in next submission you separate the proposals from the profiles links. Also in that document, there is no need to attach screenshot of freelancing profiles( Guru and Fiverr). Just a written proposal is more than enough.
* The proposal should have the following format :point_down: 
 * Start with a salutation. For example Dear John,
 * Give brief introduction about yourself.
 * Mention some previous worked projects.
 * Mention the model you will follow for current request with steps.
 * Mention a bidding price.
For example take a reference from the following proposal :point_down:
![Full.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1603134812/Full.png)


### FEEDBACK FOR CURRENT PROPOSAL
* **Guru proposal** :white_check_mark:
*Salutation is correctly used here*
* **Fiverr propsal** :x:
*Salution should be of format **`Dear John(or any other name)`**. As you now you have just mentioned **`Dears`** which is incorrect :point_down:*

## NOTE
* For this and subsequent specifications to be evaluated you need to provide a file with two proposals for different freelancing sites. Currently I can see one proposal which is for **Guru**. Instead of gig, you need to include a similar proposal for **Fiverr** profile too. Until it is present , this specification is marked as **Requires Changes**.

***************************************************************************************************************************
Proposals are present in a separate  file :white_check_mark:

### Suggestion
You could combine both the proposals in a single document for this project ie. two proposals in single document.


**You need to keep the proposals in a separate document**.  Please make **two documents** .
* One should include links to your profiles (LinkedIn, Guru/Fiverr/PeoplePerHour/Upwork/Freelancer)
* Other should contain the two proposals. 

As mentioned above, please make **two documents** .
* One should include links to your profiles (LinkedIn, Guru/Fiverr/PeoplePerHour)
* Other should contain the two proposals. 


## NOTE
As mentioned above, you need to **attach a written proposal from Fiverr instead of gig.** Hence this specification is not passed yet.

## NOTE
As mentioned above, you need to separate your proposals to separate document file. Hence this specification is not passed yet.

***************************************************************************************************************************

Short and apt introduction is present:white_check_mark:


**Short and apt introduction :x:**
You need to give a short introduction about yourself before going ahead with the proposal. For example take a look at the following sample proposal , how the person introduces himself/herself before the actual proposal :point_down:

### Sample Proposal With Introduction
![Intro.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1603220722/Intro.png)


You need to write two proposals one for each freelancing profile.The people per hour proposal is almost correct. For Fiverr proposal, write a similar proposal like the one you have written for People Per Hour instead of mentioning the Gig.

* Start with a salutation. For example Dear John,
* Give brief introduction about yourself.
* Mention some previous worked projects.
* Mention the model you will follow for current request with steps.
* Mention a bidding price.
For example take a reference from the following proposal :point_down:

This specification would be reviewed once you modify the proposal for Fiverr.
***************************************************************************************************************************

Similar projects have been listed in the proposals :white_check_mark:

**Great work providing the direct links to the previous projects :clap:**

Relevant skills to achieve the client's request have been listed in the proposal  :white_check_mark: 

You have mentioned that you have experience about the project but 

**1.** You need to give **brief description about one or two similar projects** you have worked on. For example take a reference from the below sample proposal where user explains briefly about a similar project :point_down:
![Experience.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1603725471/Experience.png)


### Suggestion
If available, I would request you to add the links to your projects in the proposal itself. While not mandatory, the clients can take a look at them directly and can make an informed decision on whether to hire you or not based on the quality of your projects.



### Why is this important?
A strong project with proven achievements can really help you get the deal from a client. As a result, it is always a good idea to include your projects and how that project created an impact in your proposal.

***
**2.** **If you don't have relevant experience, mention skills that you have that will help in the project.**
Example of skills:
 * Experience in tools that will help get the job done (e.g., Excel, Tableau, Google Ads).
 * Language skills that will help in the project (e.g., SQL, Python, HTML & CSS).




### Suggestion
**Try to give a brief introduction about the similar projects that you have worked on to catch the reader's attention. Once the reader gets engaged, there are high chances that he/she will go through the attached link.  If you directly provide the link without giving any briefing, there are high chances that reader may not open the link**

This specification could only be checked once you submit 2 different proposals.


* I couldn't find the FIverr proposal . Link to the gig is attached, but you need to write up a sample proposal.
Please write up a sample proposal and attach it in a document. This specification could be tested once you do the same.
* Talking about the People Per Hour proposal. It is quite short for a proposal. You give some short introduction about yourself,followed by some similar projects you worked on before and who you would achieve the same. Don''t restrict the proposal to just few lines.  

***************************************************************************************************************************


* Project Implementation model is included :white_check_mark:
* Steps are mentioned in bullet points :white_check_mark:

You need to ** provide a model specifying how you would achieve the employer's request with steps written in Bullet Points.** Take a reference from the sample proposal (for website design request) :point_down:

![Bullet Point.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1603725813/Bullet_Point.png)


**You have mentioned everything in  bullet points. Bullet points should only be used to list the steps that you will follow to deliver the employer's request. Please make sure you use bullet points only for project solution steps**

## What's the Expectation here
**What we want you to show to complete this rubric point is how you would go about completing the project. Give a detailed, step by step process so the client can understand how you want to complete the project.**

**Example : ** If the client wants the project done in 5 weeks, You could add the following to the proposal:
```
I recommend completing the project in two steps:
* Xx - 2 Weeks.
* Xx - 1 Week.
* Xx - 1 Week
* Xx - 1 Week
```
***
**In case there is no project timeline provided by the client**, you can **simply provide a model specifying how you would achieve the employer's request with steps written in Bullet Points.** Take a reference from the sample proposal (for website design request) :point_down:
![Bullet Point.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1603725813/Bullet_Point.png)

***************************************************************************************************************************
Project proposals contain a reasonable bidding amount :white_check_mark:

Project proposals contain a reasonable bidding amount for:
* Guru :white_check_mark:
* People Per Hour :x:
*Please include an hourly rate in your people per hour proposal as well, just like you have done for Guru proposal. Currently I couldn't find any hourly rate in your proposal :point_down:*

You need to provide a bidding amount in the proposals. 
Take a reference from the sample proposal (for website design request) :point_down:
![Bidding.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1603726052/Bidding.png)

You have mentioned the hourly rate but what the specification actually requires is a bidding amount.

You need to provide a bidding amount in the proposals. 
Bidding price usually means the amount you would take to complete the required request.  So you could either :
* **Mention the price for complete project. For eg. 200$ or 500$ etc. **
* **Mention your hourly rate and then specify the estimated  number of hours it would take to complete the project. For eg. 10$/hr and it would take 15 hrs to do the project**

## REQUIRES CHANGE
One of the previous reviewers overlooked this specification and it can't be undone now. However, I would still like to let you know that it requires change
