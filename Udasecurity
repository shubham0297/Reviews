* If pending alarm and all sensors are inactive, return to no alarm state.:white_check_mark:
* If alarm is active, change in sensor state should not affect the alarm state.:white_check_mark:
* If a sensor is activated while already active and the system is in pending state, change it to alarm state.:white_check_mark:
* If a sensor is deactivated while already inactive, make no changes to the alarm state.:white_check_mark:

* If the camera image does not contain a cat, change the status to no alarm as long as the sensors are not active.:white_check_mark:
* If the system is disarmed, set the status to no alarm.:white_check_mark:
* If the system is armed, reset all sensors to inactive.:white_check_mark:

## Congratulations !
This a complicated nanodegree, but in the end it is one of the most valuable skills to have in the industry.
You have really worked hard on this project and the project is the reflection of it. The hard work did pay off and you have passed with flying colors. :rainbow:

Few things which I like about your project :
* **The code coverage was well above 90% and every case was successfully tested :clap:**
* **The naming convention was according to lesson taught in the classroom** :clap:


Hope this course was fun and learning was useful.
 
Good luck with whatever comes next! :)
We look forward to receiving your future project submissions soon .

## Hi There !!

You have done a great job considering it was your first attempt. Most of the scenarios were successfully met.  **The application meets all the functional requirements. Few things that I liked about your project** :clap:. 

* **Nice work fixing the functionalities, the app is working fine now :clap:**
* **The test cases were written correctly, great work on that too :clap:**

You are close to the appropriate project,however you need to correct a small point before you're all set to go. 

* **You need to provide the generated `spotbugs.html` file in order to pass the project.**

Hope you make the required changes soon. We look forward to receiving your future project submissions soon .
