### 1. Professional tone is used throughout the Eol :heavy_check_mark:
### 2. The expression of interest is within the word limits :heavy_check_mark:

**As mentioned in the rubric point, the EoI should be between 200-300 words. As of now your EoI is of 124 words. Please make sure it is within the range **

### 1. Professional tone is used throughout the Eol :heavy_check_mark:
### 2. The expression of interest is quite long :x: 
**Expression of Interests are short messages sent to the client to express interest in the client's project. I would recommend going through the introduction of EoIs in the classroom lecture here -** [**Introduction of Eols**](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd083/parts/e01cbb55-3c1f-4682-9b70-f46c3c0d94e2/modules/73e443ba-5287-431c-a57d-53060e87c06e/lessons/3438ba01-e07c-4523-8de5-5e3d6d74876f/concepts/8dc56338-1268-4990-9fe5-02a0a316b420?contentVersion=1.0.0&contentLocale=en-us) .

**Note 💡 **
 Remember that the client may have many EoIs to go through and at this point they are just trying to filter out the freelancers they want to talk

If you are going though a freelancing platform, they even limit the EoI to as low as 300 characters. This is to avoid the client having to go through long EoIs. Also, you as a freelancer will be writing a lot of EoIs before you get a client - keeping them short will make it sustainable.

## Whats done correctly  :heavy_check_mark:
** A solution has been proposed to the client's need** :white_check_mark:

## What requires change :x:
As mentioned in the previous review, you need to **identify the potential client's needs. **
**You need to start the Eol by  acknowledging the client’s problem/need. Look at the sample Eol given below to see how the freelancer has acknowledged the client's need :point_down:**

### Positive impact of provided solution has been listed in the EOL :heavy_check_mark:


## REQUIRES CHANGE
* **In this specification, you are expected to tell how your proposed solution will positively impact the client's business like (cost efficiency, speed efficiency, revenue generation etc.). This is your chance to stand-out amongst other freelancer. If you are able to convince that your solution will positively impact their business, there are high chances the client will select you to achieve his request**


* **For eg. if your proposed solution is using the `React` library, then you should be able to tell how React is going to help the client. This should be related to business aspect. For instance, it would increase the site's performance and therefore have more userbase**


* **Currently you have mentioned, that you will be using `ReactJs` and what it does. But there will be thousands of developers who will be using `React`. So, it becomes important to somehow convince the client about your solution. This can be done by connecting the technical solution (using `React` and its advantages) to the business aspect like revenue, increased user, high availability of website etc.**


* **For eg. your proposed solution is using the `Microsoft Power BI` library, then you should be able to tell how `Microsoft Power BI` is going to help the client. This should be related to business aspect. For instance, how will `Microsoft Power BI` help the client's 'Insurance business'.**

### Suggestion
**I good way to do this is to use the following format : **
```
By using  X tool  Y can be acheived resulting in Z (Here Z can be the business value for the insure company. For eg. revenue, profit, cost/time saving etc)
 ```



## REQUIRES CHANGE
**This part of the statement is missing. You need to mention how your proposed solution will be beneficial to the client's business ie. how it will positively impact the client's business. This can be related to any of the "business" aspects such as increased customer retention, cost efficiency, revenue generation etc.**

**Note 💡  **  : Your goal as a freelancer is not just to influence the client with your skills but also how your skills will lead to increased profits for the client.

:warning: Looks like this part of the statement is missing. Always remember to mention how your proposed solution will be beneficial to the client's business. This discussion should be focused on "business" aspects such as increased customer retention, etc. rather than generic statements such as "saving time". Remember that your goal as a freelancer is not just to influence the client with your skills but also how your skills will lead to increased profits for the client :)


**This specification would be tested, once you implement the change suggested in  the previous point**.

* **For eg. if your proposed solution is using the `XYZ` plugin/function, then you should be able to tell how that  plugin/function is going to help the client. This should be related to business aspect. **


* **For eg. if your proposed solution is using the `MailChimp`, then you should be able to tell how that  `MailChimp` is going to help the client. This should be related to business aspect. **

### 1. Trello board should have overall 5 columns :x:
**I can see that your Trello board has only 3 milestone columns. Please add two more milestone columns in order to have a total of 5**

### Trello boards includes the following 3 columns :
*  **Development**  :white_check_mark:
*  **Review** :white_check_mark:
* **Payment Process** :white_check_mark:

The logical ordering of milestone is important as well. In an ideal world scenario, Payment would be the last step. Once you deliver all the items to the client from your side, then only the client pays you. So, it doesn't make sense to add milestone after the Payment Process. Make sure to keep Payment process as the last milestone.

I would recommend you to go through this link to understand the terminologies of the Trello Board  - [Getting Started With Trello Board](https://blog.trello.com/trello-board-best-practices)

**Please make sure that  all the action cards have a `Due Date` , `Description` (atleast  a sentence long) and `Checklist` (with  at least 2 items in it) . You can take a look at a following action card to get an idea how an ideal action card looks like :point_down:**

**This is just the checklist name. You need to add items to the checklist. Checklist is nothing but breaking down the action card into smaller task. Please add atleast 2 items to the checklist for some action cards.**

### 1. Trello board has logical action cards that fit the project workflow under milestone columns that detail the action items for the milestone. :x:

* The trello board should have logical milestones and then logical action cards.
* Think of milestone as a Project Phase. For eg. Development is a phase in which all the development activities will take place. So, Development can be one milestone column under which you can have several action cards related to the development like Home Page PSD conversion to custom HTML code etc.
* In your Trello board you have mentioned HTML,CSS, JavaScript as milestone columns which are not logical . These can be the action cards under some milestone column but not the column itself.
![2022-01-06_18-24.png](https://udacity-reviews-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/_attachments/263256/1641473660/2022-01-06_18-24.png)
***
### 2. Action cards have the following :
  * **Due Date** 
  * **Description**
  * **Checklist** 
This part will be checked once you make the changes in the Trello Board and add logical action cards. For eg. one action card under development milestone column can be Home Page PSD conversion to custom code with checklists as HTML code to Home Page, CSS for Home Page etc.  

* **Try to give logical names to the action cards such that a person viewing your Trello Board can look at the name of the card and get an idea about what will be done in that particular card**
* **The project listing requires you to convert 10 PSD to custom code, so you can imagine a real word website and  think abut different pages it has. For eg. instead of naming  action cards as `javascript` , `development` etc you can name the cards as  `Welcome Page HTML`, `About US Page Code` etc. These make more sense and can be easily moved from one milestone to other based on their status on completion. Lets say if `Welcome Page` is 50% developed, it could be under development milestone. Once it is fully developed, it can me moved to Review milestone.**
* You can take a look at a following action card to get an idea how an ideal action card looks like :point_down:

## REQUIRES CHANGE
**There are few issues that need to be resolved : **
1. **As mentioned in the previous review, the action cards under the Payment milestones don't have any relation with the Payment. The action cards under a milestone should be related to the milestone in some way.**
2. **Last 2 milestones ie. ` Evaluate CSS files`  and `Evaluate JavaScript interaction` look like action cards rather than milestone. Think of milestone as a phase of project. It should have multiple action cards that should relate to the milestone heading. 
Also, the order of milestone is important. In real world scenario, payment is the last phase of the project, so payment should always be the last milestone**

### 1. Invoice contains the total payment :heavy_check_mark:
### 2. Breakdown of services has been  done in the invoice :heavy_check_mark:


***

### **Additional Readings**
* **Here is a good read about how to write an invoice as a freelancer which covers the important tips, tricks and template to write a professional looking invoices - ** [** Writing an Invoice For Freelancers**](https://www.freelancermap.com/blog/writing-an-invoice-for-freelancers-tips-tricks-templates/)



* [How to write an invoice as freelancer](https://www.upwork.com/resources/how-to-write-an-invoice-for-freelance-work)
* In your freelancing journey you can use invoicing tools to generate professional invoices:
1) [Free Invoice Builder](https://freeinvoicebuilder.com/)
2) [Incoively](https://invoicely.com/)
3) [Invoice Generator](https://invoice-generator.com/)

:warning: An invoice like this makes it seem like you barely did anything. It is advisable to break down a large task into subtasks and list them all separately. Make sure you highlight every task from your Trello board into the invoice


**Though the breakdown of the services has been done but it doesn't look professional and most likely there are chances that your invoice may not get cleared. Think from a client's point of view when writing the invoice. The person receiving the invoice will see that you are charging lets say 800$ for Page1. When someone is paying 800$, he would be expecting atleast a proper name and description of the service. For eg. **
* You can write a service like `Development - Phase 1` and then provide the description what all you did as phase 1 development  OR
* You can also provide individual services like `Home Page Development` and then provide a line of description on what all you did in this service.

I would recommend you to change the service names and description to keep it more professional so that client is satisfied and clears the invoice without any questions. 


### Suggestion
* **You can write a service like `Development`, `Testing` etc and then provide in the description section mention what all you did as a part of the service **
OR
* **You can also provide individual services like `Home Page Development`, `About Us Page` and then provide a line of description on what all you did in this service.**

************************************************************************************************************************************************
### The invoice includes a payment deadline with reasonable time gap between generated date and due date.:heavy_check_mark:


***
### Suggestion 💡
**I would suggest you to keep at least 2 weeks gap between the `Date issued` and `Date due`. This is recommended as the invoice has to be validated and goes through various steps before it is cleared and payment is made. This process may take couple of weeks, so it is a good practice to give at least 2 weeks or month gap between the two dates**


:x: Payment deadline is too short. 1 day is not even enough to process your invoice. Ideally it's advisable to give your client atleast 1 month to clear the payment. Sometimes clients may need to pass these invoices through several stakeholders in their business such as the finance team. So processing delays are to be expected.

************************************************************************************************************************************************

### The invoice lists the accepted mode of payment :heavy_check_mark:


### The invoice lists the accepted mode of payment :x:
**How will your client pay you if they don't know your account details? You can enter any dummy data here, no need to specify real details. Consider an example:
A/C: 12AB-34CD
Bank: Dummy Bank**


***
### Suggestion
**I would suggest you to always keep at least 2 modes of payment. This is recommended so that on an unlucky day, if one payment mode fails to work, the client would have an alternate way to transfer the amount** 



**Note 💡 :** It is recommended to specify atleast 2 modes of payment in case one of them fails. This would avoid the hassle of payment delays in case your default payment mode doesn't work for the client or is unavailable in their country.


### 1. The invoice lists the accepted mode of payment :x:
**Your client should also know how he should pay you for the invoice you sent to him. For this, you need to  mention the mode of payment by which you wish the money to be transferred. For eg. Paypal, Bank Transfer, Payoneer etc.**
***
### 2. Payment details are missing from your included invoice. :x:
**Once you tell the accepted mode of payment, you also need to provide some dummy details in the invoice.  For example:**
A/C: 12879EG998234
Bank: Dummy Bank
In case of paypal/payoneer - you could provide the email related to the paypal/payoneer account (For eg. abcd@gmail.com)

***
### Suggestion 💡
**It is often recommended to keep at least 2 modes of payment. This is recommended so that on an unlucky day, if one payment mode fails to work, the client would have an alternate way to transfer the amount**

## Hi !
You did an amazing job considering it was your first attempt. Its really good to see that ** you have maintained a professional tone throughout the EOI and have maintained logical action card for every milestone in your Trello board.**  :clap: 

You are very close to the appropriate project, however, you need to correct couple of small points before you're all set to go.

* **EOI should be between 200-300 words**
* **You need to start the EOI by acknowledging the client's requirement**
* **You need to propose a proper solution (this can be any specific tool/library/technique/skillset etc. )  to the client's problem **
* **EOI should also include the positive impact of your proposed solution on client's business**
* **Trello board doesn't have logical milestone and action cards**
* **Please provide the correct link to your Trello board (not the  invitation link, but the board link)   **
* **Please provide the correct link to your Trello board that lands on your board without asking the users to sign in or sign up  **
* **You need to have overall 5 milestone columns in your Trello board out of which 3 should be - `Development`, `Review` and ` Payment`**
* **The Milestone columns and Action Cards need to be logical so that it makes sense. `Milestone` are the different phases in which a project may be divided and `Action cards` are the tasks that are performed in each milestone to achieve that milestone**
* **Make sure at least 3(or preferably all) action cards have a `Due Date`, `Description` (at least 1 sentence long) and `Checklist` (with at least 2 checklist items)**
* **The service breakdown in the invoice requires change. It should be more descriptive**
* **Provide some dummy details for the accepted mode of payments in the invoice template**
* **Provide some accepted modes of payment with dummy details for each of the mode in the invoice template.**


Hope you make the required changes soon. We look forward to receiving your future project submissions soon .

1. Milestones of a project usually represent the phase 
of a project. These milestone headings don't make much sense.
For eg. Development is a phase in a project. Similarly Review is a phase in 
project, but Evaulate CSS files looks like a sub-task ie. action card of some
milestone.
2. Also, the milestones should be in logical order. For eg. once payment 
milestone is acheived, the project ends. So, adding 2 more milestones after
the Payment milestone doesn't make sense logically. Ideally Payment should 
be the last milestone
